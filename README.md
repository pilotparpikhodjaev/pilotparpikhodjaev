### National Geospatial Exchange Platform

High-load, event-driven integration platform serving as the central nervous system for government data sharing across Uzbekistan. Built on RabbitMQ and Celery for asynchronous processing of massive GeoJSON datasets, with custom WebGL engine for time-series visualization.

### InSAR Displacement Pipeline

Automated pipeline processing Sentinel-1 SLC data to detect millimeter-level ground displacement for infrastructure monitoring — dams, railways, mining operations.

### Nationwide EV Charging Network

Complete B2C platform with native mobile application and Spring Boot backend. Implemented OCPP 2.0 protocol for real-time station management and billing infrastructure.

### Fintech Core (MoneySend)

Engineered Anorbank's payment gateway with zero-trust architecture, mTLS, and request signing. ISO/PCI-DSS compliance with zero-transaction-loss reliability.
